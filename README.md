# Vulnerable-web-application
## Course project for Cyber Security Base with F-Secure by University of Helsinki

- This application allows you to create notes that everyone can see after logging in, it will have at least five vulnerabilities from the [OWASP top ten vulnerabilities list](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10). Each vulnerability will have instructions for identifying and fixing them.

## A1-Injection
### How this vulnerability can be identified?
* This is a SQL injection vulnerability in the login form. To manually exploit this vulnerability, the easiest way is by inputting any name and in the password field typing something like "NotRealPass'OR'1'='1". This will log the user in as whatever is the first queried account. More specific queries can also be made for specific accounts.
### How this vulnerability can be fixed?
* Fixing this problem would be easy using Spring repositories, as used for every other query in this application. Other ways could be parameterized SQL queries or escaping all user input.

## A3-Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
### How this vulnerability can be identified?
* When creating a note on the home page, JavaScript can be written as a part of the message, it is then sent to the browser of whoever views the note. Example of this is: "MyNote<script>console.log("message");</script>".
### How this vulnerability can be fixed?
* With Thymeleaf to fix this vulnerability you just need to change th:utext to th:text. Other ways of fixing include sanitizing and escaping the input.

## A8-Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
### How this vulnerability can be identified?
* While logged in, open the csrf.html file in folder external-resources using the same browser. In the input field write your note and then submit. The note will now be stored and displayed to be posted by the active user. This vulnerability can also use the XSS vulnerability mentioned above.
### How this vulnerability can be fixed?
* A CSRF token has to be added to prevent CSRF attacks. In Spring this can be done automatically using the Spring security framework by adding line "http.csrf();" inside the security configurate function. It will then automatically add a CSRF token when needed.

## Other: Brute-force attacks
### How this vulnerability can be identified?
* As no security exists to prevents trying to login multiple times, any brute-force attack types can be used to get the login credentials.
### How this vulnerability can be fixed?
* There are many methods to block brute-force attacks, perhaps the simplest way would be adding a CAPTCHA after multiple attempts.
